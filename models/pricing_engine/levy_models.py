    Implements the characteristic function for the Variance Gamma (VG) model.

    The VG model is defined by three parameters:
    - sigma: Volatility of the underlying Brownian motion.
    - nu: Variance rate of the gamma process. Controls kurtosis (fat tails).
           A small nu leads to fatter tails.
    - theta: Drift of the Brownian motion. Controls skewness.
             A negative theta leads to a left-skewed distribution (negative skew).
