# Project Guideline: Machine Learning for Calibrating Advanced Asset Pricing Models

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1. Introduction

This document outlines the step-by-step implementation plan for the project: "Machine Learning for Calibrating Advanced Asset Pricing Models to Market Data". The goal is to build a production-quality calibration engine that is significantly faster than traditional optimization methods and provides insight into the stability and uncertainty of the fitted model.

### 1.2. Problem Statement

Standard Black-Scholes models fail to capture market phenomena like "fat tails" and jumps. Lévy models (e.g., Variance Gamma, CGMY) are more realistic but are computationally expensive to calibrate to market option prices. This project aims to solve this bottleneck by leveraging machine learning.

### 1.3. Proposed Solution

We will frame the calibration as a complex regression task. A deep neural network will be trained to learn the inverse mapping from an option price surface to the Lévy model parameters. We will also explore Bayesian methods to quantify calibration uncertainty.

## 2. Phase 1: Project Scaffolding and Documentation

### 2.1. Directory Structure

First, we will establish a clean and scalable project structure.

```

### 2.2. Initial Documentation

We will create the essential documentation files.

**Action:** Create the following files with initial placeholder content:

*   `README.md`: Project landing page.
*   `CONTRIBUTING.md`: Contribution guidelines.
*   `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`: Code of conduct.
*   `SECURITY.md`: Security policy.
*   `CHANGELOG.md`: Versioned updates.
*   `.gitignore`: To exclude unnecessary files from version control.

### 2.3. README.md

The `README.md` will be the first entry point for users and contributors.

**Action:** Create a professional `README.md` with the following sections:

*   Project Title and Description
*   Badges (Build Status, License, etc.)
*   Introduction
*   Project Structure
*   Installation and Usage
*   Examples & Visualizations (initially with placeholders)
*   Validation & Results Summary (initially with placeholders)
*   Roadmap & TODOs
*   License and Contribution Guidelines

## 3. Phase 2: Data Generation and Feature Engineering

### 3.1. Fractional PDE Solver

The core of the data generation is a robust pricing engine. We will start with a Fourier-based pricer, as it is a standard method for Lévy models.

**Action:** Implement the pricing engine in `models/pricing_engine/`.

*   `levy_models.py`: Implement the characteristic functions for Variance Gamma and CGMY models.
*   `fourier_pricer.py`: Implement a generic Fourier pricing formula (e.g., Carr-Madan) that takes a characteristic function as input.

### 3.2. Synthetic Data Generation

We will generate a large dataset of (option price surface, Lévy model parameters) pairs.

**Action:** Implement the data generation script in `models/generate_dataset.py`.

*   Use a Sobol sequence to generate a large number of parameter sets for the chosen Lévy model.
*   For each parameter set, use the pricing engine to compute the corresponding option price surface over a fixed grid of strikes and maturities.
*   Save the dataset to `data/synthetic/` in a memory-efficient format like Parquet.

### 3.3. Feature Engineering

The raw option price surface will be the input to our neural network. We may need to transform it for better performance.

**Action:** Implement the feature engineering pipeline in `features/`.

*   `build_features.py`: Create a script to load the synthetic dataset and apply transformations.
*   Initial features will be the flattened price surface. We can later explore adding implied volatilities or other derived features.

## 4. Phase 3: Model Development and Training

### 4.1. Calibration Network

We will build a deep neural network to learn the inverse mapping.

**Action:** Implement the calibration network in `models/calibration_net/`.

*   `model.py`: Define the neural network architecture (e.g., a simple MLP to start).
*   `train.py`: Implement the training loop, including data loading, model training, and evaluation.
*   `predict.py`: Implement a script to load a trained model and make predictions on new data.

### 4.2. Bayesian Calibration

To quantify uncertainty, we will explore Bayesian methods.

**Action:** Implement the Bayesian calibration model in `models/bayesian_calibration/`.

*   `mcmc.py`: Implement a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based calibration using a library like `tensorflow-probability`.
*   This will be a more advanced and computationally intensive method.

## 5. Phase 4: Backtesting and Validation

### 5.1. Backtesting Engine

We need a robust backtesting engine to evaluate the performance of our calibration method.

**Action:** Implement the backtesting engine in `backtesting/`.

*   `engine.py`: Implement a simple event-driven backtesting engine.
*   `strategy.py`: Implement a simple strategy that uses the calibrated parameters to price options and identify mispricings.

### 5.2. Robust Validation

We will perform a series of validation tests to ensure the robustness of our models.

**Action:** Implement the validation scripts in `analysis/`.

*   `out_of_sample.py`: Perform out-of-sample validation.
*   `forward_walking.py`: Implement forward-walking validation.
*   `significance_testing.py`: Perform statistical significance tests.
*   `sensitivity_analysis.py`: Analyze the sensitivity of the model to key parameters.

## 6. Phase 5: Productionization and Deployment

### 6.1. API

We will expose the calibration engine via a REST API.

**Action:** Implement the API in `production/api/`.

*   `main.py`: Use FastAPI to create the API endpoints.
*   The API will take an option price surface as input and return the calibrated parameters.

### 6.2. CI/CD

We will set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.

**Action:** Create the workflow files in `.github/workflows/`.

*   `ci.yml`: On every push, run tests, linting, and code formatting.
*   `cd.yml`: On every release, build and publish the documentation, and deploy the API (placeholder for now).

## 7. Phase 6: Final Touches

### 7.1. Project Identity

We will create a professional identity for the project.

**Action:**

*   Create a simple logo or banner for the `README.md`.
*   Ensure all plots and charts are color-coordinated and have clear labels.
*   Establish a consistent naming scheme for branches, commits, and releases.

### 7.2. Documentation

We will create comprehensive documentation for the project.

**Action:**

*   Use the `docs` folder to create a GitHub Pages site.
*   Include an API reference, system diagrams, and design principles.
*   Use Mermaid or PlantUML for diagrams.

This detailed plan will guide us through the project. We will start with Phase 1 and proceed step-by-step.
