# Design Principles and Assumptions

This document outlines the core design principles and assumptions guiding the development of the Levy Model Calibration Engine.

## Design Principles

1.  **Modularity:** The system is designed with clear separation of concerns. Each major component (data, features, models, backtesting, analysis, production) resides in its own directory, promoting independent development and easier maintenance.
2.  **Scalability:** Components are designed to handle large datasets and potentially high-throughput requests (e.g., FastAPI for the API, Parquet for data storage).
3.  **Reproducibility:** Emphasis is placed on clear configuration, version control, and automated testing to ensure that results can be consistently reproduced.
4.  **Extensibility:** The architecture allows for easy integration of new Levy models, pricing methods, ML algorithms, and validation techniques.
5.  **Performance:** Critical components, especially the pricing engine and ML inference, are optimized for speed.
6.  **Robustness:** Error handling, validation, and comprehensive testing are integral to ensure the system's reliability.
7.  **Transparency:** Documentation, clear code, and detailed explanations of methodologies are prioritized to foster understanding and trust.

## Key Assumptions

1.  **Market Efficiency (for backtesting):** While the project aims to identify mispricings, the backtesting environment assumes a certain level of market efficiency where identified arbitrage opportunities can be exploited (within realistic transaction costs and liquidity constraints).
2.  **Data Availability:** We assume access to historical market option data (for real-world validation) and the ability to generate synthetic data for training.
3.  **Model Validity:** We assume that Levy models (Variance Gamma, CGMY) are appropriate representations of the underlying asset price dynamics for the purpose of option pricing.
4.  **Stationarity (for ML training):** The ML model assumes some degree of stationarity in the relationship between option price surfaces and Levy model parameters. Significant regime shifts in market behavior might require model retraining.
5.  **Computational Resources:** Adequate computational resources (CPU/GPU) are available for training deep learning models and running extensive simulations.
6.  **Python Ecosystem:** The project is built primarily within the Python ecosystem, leveraging its rich libraries for data science, machine learning, and quantitative finance.
7.  **FastAPI for API:** FastAPI is chosen for its performance and ease of use in building Python-based APIs.
8.  **GitHub Actions for CI/CD:** GitHub Actions is the chosen platform for continuous integration and deployment workflows.

## Future Considerations (Beyond Initial Scope)

*   **Real-time Data Integration:** Integrating with live market data feeds.
*   **Advanced Optimization:** Exploring more sophisticated optimization techniques for model training.
*   **Uncertainty Quantification:** Further development of Bayesian methods for a more rigorous quantification of parameter uncertainty.
*   **User Interface:** Developing a user-friendly interface for interacting with the calibration engine.
